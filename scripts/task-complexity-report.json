      "taskId": 1,
      "taskTitle": "Configuration File Parser Implementation",
      "complexityScore": 6,
      "recommendedSubtasks": 5,
      "expansionPrompt": "Break down the configuration file parser implementation into subtasks such as file reading, syntax parsing, error handling, data structure design, and default value management.",
      "reasoning": "Parsing configuration files with error handling and data structure mapping is moderately complex, especially with C++98 constraints and no external libraries. The task involves multiple concerns: file I/O, parsing logic, error management, and data storage, each of which can be a subtask."

      "taskTitle": "Server Socket Initialization",
      "complexityScore": 7,
      "recommendedSubtasks": 6,
      "expansionPrompt": "Expand server socket initialization into subtasks such as address resolution, socket creation, option setting, binding, non-blocking configuration, and listening setup.",
      "reasoning": "Socket initialization requires careful handling of system calls, error management, and platform-specific nuances. Each step (address resolution, creation, binding, etc.) is distinct and error-prone, justifying multiple subtasks."

      "taskTitle": "Event Loop Implementation with I/O Multiplexing",
      "complexityScore": 8,
      "recommendedSubtasks": 7,
      "expansionPrompt": "Decompose event loop implementation into subtasks: data structure setup, server socket registration, event polling, new connection handling, client I/O processing, timeout management, and resource cleanup.",
      "reasoning": "Implementing a robust event loop with non-blocking I/O and multiplexing is complex, involving concurrency, resource management, and integration with other components. Each aspect (polling, connection, I/O, timeouts) is a significant subtask."

      "taskTitle": "HTTP Request Parser",
      "complexityScore": 7,
      "recommendedSubtasks": 6,
      "expansionPrompt": "Break down HTTP request parsing into subtasks: request line parsing, header parsing, body extraction, chunked encoding handling, partial request management, and HTTP/1.1 compliance validation.",
      "reasoning": "HTTP parsing must handle various formats, partial data, and protocol compliance. Each parsing phase (line, headers, body, chunked encoding) is non-trivial and benefits from focused subtasks."

      "taskId": 5,
      "taskTitle": "HTTP Response Generator",
      "complexityScore": 6,
      "recommendedSubtasks": 5,
      "expansionPrompt": "Expand HTTP response generation into subtasks: status code mapping, header management, body formatting, response serialization, and chunked encoding support.",
      "reasoning": "Generating HTTP responses is moderately complex, requiring correct formatting, header management, and optional chunked encoding. Each responsibility can be a subtask."

      "taskTitle": "Static File Handler",
      "complexityScore": 7,
      "recommendedSubtasks": 7,
      "expansionPrompt": "Decompose static file handling into subtasks: URI-to-path mapping, security checks, MIME type detection, file reading, file writing, file deletion, and error response generation.",
      "reasoning": "Serving static files involves security, MIME handling, and multiple file operations (read, write, delete), each with its own complexity and error cases."

      "taskId": 7,
      "taskTitle": "Client Connection Handler",
      "complexityScore": 8,
      "recommendedSubtasks": 7,
      "expansionPrompt": "Break down client connection handling into subtasks: connection acceptance, non-blocking read, request buffering, request processing, non-blocking write, keep-alive management, and timeout handling.",
      "reasoning": "Managing client connections in a non-blocking, concurrent environment is complex, requiring careful state management and integration with the event loop. Each lifecycle phase is a logical subtask."

      "taskTitle": "Error Page Handler",
      "complexityScore": 5,
      "recommendedSubtasks": 4,
      "expansionPrompt": "Expand error page handling into subtasks: default template creation, custom error page loading, error response generation, and fallback logic implementation.",
      "reasoning": "Error page handling is less complex but still involves template management, configuration integration, and fallback logic, each suitable as a subtask."

      "taskTitle": "Request Router and Handler",
      "complexityScore": 7,
      "recommendedSubtasks": 6,
      "expansionPrompt": "Decompose request routing into subtasks: server config selection, method validation, URI validation, handler dispatch, special case handling (directory/index), and error response integration.",
      "reasoning": "Routing requests involves multiple decision points and integration with other handlers, making it moderately complex and suitable for several subtasks."

      "expansionPrompt": "Break down server integration and testing into subtasks: component initialization, signal handling, shutdown procedure, logging setup, integration testing, stress testing, NGINX comparison, and resource monitoring.",
      "reasoning": "Integrating all components and ensuring robust operation under real-world conditions is highly complex, involving coordination, testing, and operational concerns, each requiring focused attention."
