      "taskId": 1,
      "taskTitle": "Implement Socket Manager and Basic Server Setup",
      "complexityScore": 7,
      "recommendedSubtasks": 5,
      "expansionPrompt": "Break down the Socket Manager implementation into detailed subtasks covering: IPv4/IPv6 socket creation, socket configuration (non-blocking, options), binding and listening functionality, connection acceptance and tracking, and resource management with proper cleanup procedures. Include error handling strategies for each subtask.",
      "reasoning": "This task involves low-level socket programming with multiple components (creation, binding, listening, accepting). It requires careful error handling and resource management across different socket states. The existing 4 subtasks are good but could benefit from more granular breakdown, especially around error handling and IPv4/IPv6 support."

      "taskId": 2,
      "taskTitle": "Implement Event Loop with Non-blocking I/O",
      "complexityScore": 8,
      "recommendedSubtasks": 6,
      "expansionPrompt": "Break down the Event Loop implementation into detailed subtasks covering: poll()/select() mechanism implementation, file descriptor registration system, event dispatching logic, timeout handling, callback management, and integration with the Socket Manager. For each subtask, include specific error handling and performance considerations.",
      "reasoning": "Event loops are complex with many edge cases around non-blocking I/O, callback timing, and resource management. The current 5 subtasks are well-structured but could use an additional subtask focused on error recovery and edge case handling. This is a core component that will impact overall server performance and stability."

      "taskId": 3,
      "taskTitle": "Implement Configuration Parser",
      "complexityScore": 7,
      "recommendedSubtasks": 7,
      "expansionPrompt": "Break down the Configuration Parser implementation into detailed subtasks covering: lexical analysis, server block parsing, route block parsing, directive validation, configuration object model design, error reporting, and configuration reloading/hot updates. For each subtask, include specific validation requirements and error handling strategies.",
      "reasoning": "Parsing configuration files requires complex grammar handling, validation logic, and error reporting. The current 6 subtasks are comprehensive but adding a subtask for configuration reloading would be valuable. The parser needs to handle a variety of directives with different validation rules and complex nested structures."

      "taskTitle": "Implement HTTP Request Parser",
      "complexityScore": 8,
      "recommendedSubtasks": 7,
      "expansionPrompt": "Break down the HTTP Request Parser implementation into detailed subtasks covering: request line parsing, header parsing, content-length body handling, chunked transfer encoding, form data parsing (both URL-encoded and multipart), query parameter extraction, and security validation. For each subtask, include specific error handling and edge case considerations.",
      "reasoning": "HTTP parsing is complex due to the many edge cases in the protocol and security considerations. The current 6 subtasks are good but should be expanded to include a dedicated security validation subtask to handle malicious inputs, oversized requests, and protocol violations."

      "taskId": 5,
      "taskTitle": "Implement HTTP Response Generator",
      "complexityScore": 6,
      "recommendedSubtasks": 5,
      "expansionPrompt": "Break down the HTTP Response Generator implementation into detailed subtasks covering: status code handling, header management, body content handling for different content types, response serialization, and compression/encoding support. For each subtask, include specific requirements for HTTP compliance and performance optimization.",
      "reasoning": "Response generation is moderately complex with fewer edge cases than request parsing. The current 4 subtasks are good but should include a subtask for compression/encoding support (gzip, deflate, etc.) which is important for performance. The task requires careful attention to HTTP protocol compliance."

      "complexityScore": 6,
      "recommendedSubtasks": 6,
      "expansionPrompt": "Break down the Static File Handler implementation into detailed subtasks covering: URL to filesystem path mapping, file reading and serving, directory listing generation, MIME type detection, security measures for path traversal prevention, and caching mechanisms. For each subtask, include specific security considerations and performance optimization strategies.",
      "reasoning": "Static file handling involves filesystem interactions, security concerns, and performance optimizations. The current 5 subtasks are good but should include a subtask for implementing caching mechanisms (ETags, Last-Modified, etc.) which are important for performance. Security is a major concern with filesystem access."

      "complexityScore": 9,
      "recommendedSubtasks": 8,
      "expansionPrompt": "Break down the Route Handler and Server Logic implementation into detailed subtasks covering: route matching algorithm, request method validation, handler dispatching mechanism, client connection management, request-response cycle orchestration, virtual host support, component integration, and performance monitoring/metrics collection. For each subtask, include specific requirements for extensibility and error handling.",
      "reasoning": "This is the most complex task as it integrates all other components and manages the complete request lifecycle. The current 7 subtasks are comprehensive but should include an additional subtask for performance monitoring and metrics collection. This component needs to be highly extensible and robust to handle various error conditions."

      "taskTitle": "Implement CGI Handler",
      "complexityScore": 8,
      "recommendedSubtasks": 6,
      "expansionPrompt": "Break down the CGI Handler implementation into detailed subtasks covering: environment variable preparation, process creation and execution, input/output handling, response parsing, error handling and timeout management, and security hardening. For each subtask, include specific security considerations and performance implications.",
      "reasoning": "CGI handling involves process management, IPC, and security concerns. The current 5 subtasks are good but should include a dedicated subtask for security hardening to prevent command injection and resource exhaustion. Process management and IPC add significant complexity to this component."

For each subtask, include specific security considerations and performance optimization strategies.",
      "reasoning": "File uploads involve complex parsing, security concerns, and filesystem operations. The current 5 subtasks are good but should include a subtask for progress tracking and resumable uploads which are important for large file handling. Security is critical when accepting files from users."

      "complexityScore": 5,
      "recommendedSubtasks": 5,
      "expansionPrompt": "Break down the Error Handler and Logging System implementation into detailed subtasks covering: error response generation, logging infrastructure with multiple levels, request/response logging, log output management and formatting, and log rotation/archiving. For each subtask, include specific requirements for configurability and performance considerations.",
      "reasoning": "Error handling and logging are relatively straightforward but important for debugging and user experience. The current 4 subtasks should be expanded to include log rotation and archiving. This component needs to be highly configurable and have minimal performance impact on the main server operations."
