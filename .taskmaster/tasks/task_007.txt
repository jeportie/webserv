# Task ID: 7
# Title: Client Connection Handler
# Status: in-progress
# Dependencies: 3, 4, 5
# Priority: medium
# Description: Implement a client connection handler that manages the lifecycle of client connections, from acceptance to closure.
# Details:
Create a Client class to manage client connections:

```cpp
class Client {
private:
    int _socketFd;
    std::string _buffer;
    HTTPRequest _request;
    HTTPResponse _response;
    time_t _lastActivity;
    bool _keepAlive;
    size_t _maxBodySize;
    
public:
    Client(int socketFd, size_t maxBodySize);
    ~Client();
    
    bool readRequest();
    bool writeResponse();
    bool hasTimedOut(time_t currentTime, int timeout) const;
    void updateActivity();
    int getSocketFd() const;
    bool isKeepAlive() const;
    void setResponse(const HTTPResponse& response);
};
```

Implementation steps:
1. Accept new client connections in the event loop
2. Read data from client socket in a non-blocking manner
3. Buffer incoming data until a complete HTTP request is received
4. Process the request and generate a response
5. Write the response to the client socket in a non-blocking manner
6. Handle keep-alive connections
7. Implement timeout mechanism to close idle connections

Ensure all socket operations are non-blocking and properly integrated with the event loop.

# Test Strategy:
1. Test handling of multiple concurrent clients
2. Verify proper buffering of partial requests
3. Test keep-alive connection handling
4. Verify timeout mechanism closes idle connections
5. Test with slow clients to ensure non-blocking behavior
6. Validate proper cleanup of client resources on disconnection

# Subtasks:
## 1. Implement connection acceptance [pending]
### Dependencies: None
### Description: Create a mechanism to accept incoming client connections efficiently
### Details:
Implement a socket listener that accepts new client connections, configures them as non-blocking, and registers them with the event loop. Include error handling for connection failures and implement backpressure mechanisms when the server is under high load.

## 2. Implement non-blocking read operations [pending]
### Dependencies: 7.1
### Description: Develop a system to read data from client sockets without blocking the event loop
### Details:
Create a non-blocking read mechanism that processes incoming data when available without waiting. Handle partial reads, implement buffering for incomplete data, and manage read events through the event loop. Include error handling for connection resets and other read failures.

## 3. Implement request buffering [pending]
### Dependencies: 7.2
### Description: Create a buffering system to accumulate and manage partial request data
### Details:
Design a buffer management system that efficiently accumulates partial request data until a complete request is received. Implement buffer size limits to prevent memory exhaustion attacks, and create a mechanism to detect when a complete request has been received and is ready for processing.

## 4. Implement request processing [pending]
### Dependencies: 7.3
### Description: Create a system to parse and process complete client requests
### Details:
Develop a request processing pipeline that parses the buffered request data, validates it, and routes it to the appropriate handler. Implement error handling for malformed requests and create a mechanism to generate appropriate responses based on the request content.

## 5. Implement non-blocking write operations [done]
### Dependencies: 7.4
### Description: Develop a system to write response data to client sockets without blocking
### Details:
Create a non-blocking write mechanism that sends response data when the socket is ready for writing. Handle partial writes, implement output buffering, and manage write events through the event loop. Include error handling for connection failures during writes.

## 6. Implement keep-alive connection management [pending]
### Dependencies: 7.5
### Description: Create a system to manage persistent connections efficiently
### Details:
Develop a keep-alive management system that maintains client connections across multiple requests. Implement connection pooling, idle connection tracking, and mechanisms to gracefully close connections when appropriate. Include support for HTTP keep-alive headers and connection reuse.

## 7. Implement timeout handling [pending]
### Dependencies: 7.6
### Description: Create a system to manage connection timeouts and resource cleanup
### Details:
Develop a timeout management system that tracks idle connections and terminates them after appropriate timeout periods. Implement different timeout policies for various connection states (connecting, reading, processing, writing) and ensure proper resource cleanup when connections are closed due to timeouts.
