# Task ID: 5
# Title: HTTP Response Generator
# Status: pending
# Dependencies: 4
# Priority: high
# Description: Implement an HTTP response generator that creates properly formatted HTTP responses with appropriate status codes and headers.
# Details:
Create an HTTPResponse class to generate HTTP responses:

```cpp
class HTTPResponse {
private:
    int _statusCode;
    std::string _statusMessage;
    std::map<std::string, std::string> _headers;
    std::string _body;
    
public:
    HTTPResponse();
    HTTPResponse(int statusCode);
    ~HTTPResponse();
    
    void setStatusCode(int code);
    void addHeader(const std::string& key, const std::string& value);
    void setBody(const std::string& body);
    
    std::string toString() const;
};
```

Implementation steps:
1. Create a map of status codes to status messages (200 OK, 404 Not Found, etc.)
2. Implement methods to set status code, add headers, and set response body
3. Generate properly formatted HTTP/1.1 responses
4. Add standard headers like Date, Content-Length, Content-Type, etc.
5. Support for chunked transfer encoding if needed

Ensure all responses conform to the HTTP/1.1 specification.

# Test Strategy:
1. Test generation of responses with various status codes
2. Verify correct formatting of headers
3. Test with different content types and body sizes
4. Validate that responses conform to HTTP/1.1 specification
5. Test with binary content to ensure proper handling

# Subtasks:
## 1. Implement HTTP status code mapping [done]
### Dependencies: None
### Description: Create a system to map application states to appropriate HTTP status codes
### Details:
Develop a comprehensive mapping between application states/conditions and standard HTTP status codes (1xx, 2xx, 3xx, 4xx, 5xx). Include functionality to select the most appropriate status code based on the current application context. Create helper methods to easily set common status codes like 200 OK, 404 Not Found, 500 Internal Server Error, etc.

## 2. Develop HTTP header management system [done]
### Dependencies: None
### Description: Create functionality to add, modify, and validate HTTP response headers
### Details:
Implement a system to manage HTTP headers including standard headers (Content-Type, Content-Length, etc.) and custom headers. Include validation for header names and values according to HTTP specifications. Provide methods for setting common headers and support for conditional headers (ETag, If-Modified-Since, etc.).

## 3. Create HTTP response body formatting [done]
### Dependencies: None
### Description: Implement functionality to format different types of response bodies
### Details:
Develop methods to handle different response body formats including plain text, HTML, JSON, XML, and binary data. Implement proper content type detection and setting. Include support for compression (gzip, deflate) and character encoding management. Ensure proper handling of empty response bodies.

## 4. Build HTTP response serialization [done]
### Dependencies: 5.1, 5.2, 5.3
### Description: Create a system to serialize complete HTTP responses into proper format
### Details:
Implement functionality to combine status codes, headers, and body into a properly formatted HTTP response. Ensure correct formatting of the status line, headers, and body separation. Handle different HTTP versions (1.0, 1.1, 2.0) appropriately. Include validation to ensure the response meets HTTP specifications before sending.

## 5. Implement chunked encoding support [done]
### Dependencies: 5.4
### Description: Add support for HTTP chunked transfer encoding
### Details:
Develop functionality to support chunked transfer encoding for HTTP/1.1 responses. Implement proper chunk formatting with size prefixes and termination sequences. Create streaming interfaces for progressive response generation. Include support for trailers in chunked responses and ensure proper end-of-stream signaling.
