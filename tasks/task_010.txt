# Task ID: 10
# Title: Main Server Integration and Testing
# Status: pending
# Dependencies: 1, 2, 3, 7, 9
# Priority: high
# Description: Integrate all components into a cohesive server application and implement comprehensive testing.
# Details:
Create a Server class that integrates all components:

```cpp
class Server {
private:
    ConfigParser _configParser;
    std::vector<Socket*> _sockets;
    EventLoop _eventLoop;
    RequestHandler _requestHandler;
    
public:
    Server(const std::string& configFile);
    ~Server();
    
    bool initialize();
    void run();
    void stop();
};

int main(int argc, char** argv) {
    if (argc != 2) {
        std::cerr << "Usage: " << argv[0] << " <config_file>" << std::endl;
        return 1;
    }
    
    Server server(argv[1]);
    if (!server.initialize()) {
        std::cerr << "Failed to initialize server" << std::endl;
        return 1;
    }
    
    server.run();
    return 0;
}
```

Implementation steps:
1. Create a main server class that initializes all components
2. Implement proper signal handling (SIGINT, SIGTERM)
3. Create a clean shutdown procedure
4. Implement logging for debugging and monitoring
5. Create a comprehensive test suite
6. Compare behavior with NGINX for validation

Ensure all components work together seamlessly and the server handles edge cases gracefully.

# Test Strategy:
1. Create integration tests with tools like curl and telnet
2. Test server with real browsers
3. Implement stress testing to verify stability under load
4. Compare responses with NGINX for validation
5. Test graceful shutdown and resource cleanup
6. Verify memory usage remains stable over time

# Subtasks:
## 1. Component Initialization Implementation [pending]
### Dependencies: None
### Description: Develop the initialization sequence for server components ensuring proper startup order and dependency handling.
### Details:
Create a robust initialization system that handles component dependencies, configuration loading, and graceful handling of initialization failures. Implement health checks during startup and establish proper communication channels between components.

## 2. Signal Handling Implementation [pending]
### Dependencies: 10.1
### Description: Implement comprehensive signal handling to manage server lifecycle events.
### Details:
Develop handlers for SIGTERM, SIGINT, SIGHUP and other relevant signals. Ensure signals trigger appropriate actions like graceful shutdown, configuration reloading, or worker process management. Include proper logging of signal events.

## 3. Shutdown Procedure Development [pending]
### Dependencies: 10.2
### Description: Create a robust shutdown sequence that ensures clean termination of all server processes.
### Details:
Implement orderly shutdown of components in reverse dependency order, ensure all connections are properly closed, resources are released, and in-flight requests are completed or properly terminated. Add timeout mechanisms for components that fail to shut down promptly.

## 4. Logging System Setup [pending]
### Dependencies: 10.1
### Description: Configure comprehensive logging throughout the server components.
### Details:
Implement structured logging with appropriate severity levels, component tagging, and context information. Set up log rotation, compression, and retention policies. Ensure sensitive information is properly redacted. Add performance metrics logging integration.

## 5. Integration Testing Framework [pending]
### Dependencies: 10.1, 10.2, 10.3, 10.4
### Description: Develop a comprehensive integration testing framework for the server.
### Details:
Create test suites that verify correct interaction between all server components. Include tests for startup/shutdown sequences, configuration changes, error conditions, and expected functionality. Implement automated test runners and reporting.

## 6. Stress Testing Implementation [pending]
### Dependencies: 10.5
### Description: Develop and execute stress tests to evaluate server performance under load.
### Details:
Create benchmarking tools to simulate high concurrency, large payloads, and sustained traffic. Measure response times, throughput, error rates, and resource utilization. Identify bottlenecks and failure points under extreme conditions.

## 7. NGINX Comparison Benchmarking [pending]
### Dependencies: 10.6
### Description: Conduct comparative performance analysis against NGINX.
### Details:
Set up equivalent NGINX configurations for comparison testing. Measure and document performance metrics including requests per second, latency, memory usage, and CPU utilization across various workloads. Analyze strengths and weaknesses relative to NGINX.

## 8. Resource Monitoring System [pending]
### Dependencies: 10.4, 10.5
### Description: Implement comprehensive resource monitoring for the server.
### Details:
Develop real-time monitoring of CPU, memory, network, and disk usage. Implement alerting thresholds for resource constraints. Create dashboards for visualizing performance metrics and resource utilization trends. Add profiling capabilities for detailed analysis.
