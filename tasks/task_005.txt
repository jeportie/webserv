# Task ID: 5
# Title: Implement HTTP Response Generator
# Status: pending
# Dependencies: 4
# Priority: high
# Description: Create a response generator that creates properly formatted HTTP responses with status codes, headers, and body content.
# Details:
Implement an HTTPResponse class that:
1. Constructs HTTP responses with status code, headers, and body
2. Formats the response according to HTTP/1.1 specification
3. Handles common headers like Content-Type, Content-Length, etc.
4. Provides methods for setting status codes and adding headers
5. Serializes the response for sending to clients

Pseudo-code:
```cpp
class HTTPResponse {
private:
    int status_code;
    std::string status_message;
    std::map<std::string, std::string> headers;
    std::string body;
    
    // Map of status codes to messages
    static std::map<int, std::string> status_messages;
    
public:
    HTTPResponse() : status_code(200) {}
    
    void setStatusCode(int code);
    void addHeader(const std::string& name, const std::string& value);
    void setBody(const std::string& content, const std::string& content_type = "text/html");
    
    std::string serialize() const;
    
    // Static helper for common responses
    static HTTPResponse makeErrorResponse(int code, const std::string& error_page = "");
};

std::string HTTPResponse::serialize() const {
    std::stringstream ss;
    
    // Status line
    ss << "HTTP/1.1 " << status_code << " " << status_message << "\r\n";
    
    // Headers
    for (const auto& header : headers) {
        ss << header.first << ": " << header.second << "\r\n";
    }
    
    // Empty line separating headers from body
    ss << "\r\n";
    
    // Body
    ss << body;
    
    return ss.str();
}

void HTTPResponse::setBody(const std::string& content, const std::string& content_type) {
    body = content;
    addHeader("Content-Type", content_type);
    addHeader("Content-Length", std::to_string(content.length()));
}
```

Implement methods in the ClientConnection class to generate and send responses based on processed requests.

# Test Strategy:
1. Unit tests for HTTPResponse class methods
2. Test generation of responses with various status codes
3. Test header formatting and serialization
4. Test body inclusion and Content-Length calculation
5. Test generation of common responses (200 OK, 404 Not Found, etc.)
6. Verify responses conform to HTTP/1.1 specification
7. Test with various content types and encodings

# Subtasks:
## 1. Implement Status Code Handling [pending]
### Dependencies: None
### Description: Create a module to manage HTTP status codes and their associated messages
### Details:
Implement a comprehensive status code handler that supports all standard HTTP status codes (1xx, 2xx, 3xx, 4xx, 5xx). Create a mapping between status codes and their standard messages. Implement validation to ensure only valid status codes are used. Support custom status messages when needed. Optimize lookup performance with O(1) access time. Include documentation for each status code and its typical use case.

## 2. Develop Header Management System [pending]
### Dependencies: 5.1
### Description: Create a flexible and compliant HTTP header handling system
### Details:
Implement case-insensitive header name storage as per HTTP spec. Support multiple values for the same header (e.g., Set-Cookie). Validate header names and values according to RFC 7230. Implement common header helpers for Content-Type, Content-Length, etc. Handle special headers like Transfer-Encoding correctly. Optimize memory usage for header storage. Include methods to add, remove, and query headers efficiently.

## 3. Implement Body Content Handling [pending]
### Dependencies: 5.2
### Description: Create handlers for different content types in HTTP responses
### Details:
Support multiple content types including text/plain, text/html, application/json, application/xml, and application/octet-stream. Implement proper Content-Type and Content-Length header setting. Create serialization helpers for common formats (JSON, XML). Support streaming for large response bodies to minimize memory usage. Implement chunked transfer encoding support. Handle character encoding correctly (UTF-8, etc.). Optimize serialization performance for large payloads.

## 4. Develop Response Serialization [pending]
### Dependencies: 5.1, 5.2, 5.3
### Description: Create a system to serialize complete HTTP responses to byte streams
### Details:
Implement efficient serialization of status line, headers, and body. Ensure proper formatting with CRLF line endings as per HTTP spec. Support both HTTP/1.0 and HTTP/1.1 serialization formats. Optimize for minimal memory allocations during serialization. Implement buffered writing for network performance. Add validation to ensure responses are well-formed. Create benchmarks to measure serialization performance under different loads.

## 5. Implement Compression and Encoding Support [pending]
### Dependencies: 5.3, 5.4
### Description: Add support for response compression and various content encodings
### Details:
Implement gzip, deflate, and brotli compression algorithms. Add proper Content-Encoding header management. Create configurable compression levels (balancing CPU vs. compression ratio). Support automatic content type-based compression decisions. Implement streaming compression for large responses. Add compression level auto-tuning based on content type. Optimize memory usage during compression. Include benchmarks comparing different compression algorithms and settings.
