# Task ID: 2
# Title: Server Socket Initialization
# Status: done
# Dependencies: None
# Priority: high
# Description: Initialize server sockets based on the parsed configuration, binding to specified host and port combinations, and setting them to non-blocking mode.
# Details:
Create a Socket class that handles socket creation, binding, and listening:

```cpp
class Socket {
private:
    int _socketFd;
    struct sockaddr_in _address;
    bool _isNonBlocking;
    
public:
    Socket(const std::string& host, int port);
    ~Socket();
    
    bool create();
    bool bind();
    bool listen(int backlog = 10);
    bool setNonBlocking();
    int accept();
    int getFd() const;
};
```

Implementation steps:
1. Use getaddrinfo() to resolve host address
2. Create socket with socket()
3. Set socket options with setsockopt() (SO_REUSEADDR)
4. Bind socket to address with bind()
5. Set socket to non-blocking mode using fcntl()
6. Start listening with listen()

Ensure proper error handling for each system call.

# Test Strategy:
1. Test socket creation with various host/port combinations
2. Verify socket is properly set to non-blocking mode
3. Test binding to already-in-use ports to ensure proper error handling
4. Validate that the server can listen on multiple addresses if configured

# Subtasks:
## 1. Implement address resolution [done]
### Dependencies: None
### Description: Resolve server address and port for socket binding
### Details:
Create functions to parse and validate IP address/hostname and port number. Implement address structure initialization for both IPv4 and IPv6. Handle conversion between string representation and binary network format. Include proper error handling for invalid addresses.

## 2. Implement socket creation [done]
### Dependencies: 2.1
### Description: Create the server socket with appropriate domain and type
### Details:
Implement socket() system call with proper error handling. Support both TCP and UDP socket types. Handle platform-specific socket creation differences. Include proper resource management to prevent socket descriptor leaks.

## 3. Implement socket option configuration [done]
### Dependencies: 2.2
### Description: Set socket options for optimal server performance
### Details:
Configure socket reuse address/port options to avoid 'Address already in use' errors. Set buffer sizes for optimal performance. Configure timeout values. Implement platform-specific optimizations like TCP_NODELAY or TCP_FASTOPEN where appropriate.

## 4. Implement socket binding [done]
### Dependencies: 2.1, 2.2, 2.3
### Description: Bind the socket to the resolved address and port
### Details:
Implement bind() system call with proper error handling. Create retry mechanism for temporary binding failures. Implement fallback strategies for when preferred ports are unavailable. Verify successful binding with appropriate checks.

## 5. Configure non-blocking socket behavior [done]
### Dependencies: 2.4
### Description: Set socket to non-blocking mode for asynchronous operation
### Details:
Implement platform-specific non-blocking socket configuration (fcntl() on UNIX, ioctlsocket() on Windows). Create abstraction layer to handle platform differences. Implement proper error handling for non-blocking mode setup. Verify socket state after configuration.

## 6. Implement listening setup [done]
### Dependencies: 2.5
### Description: Configure socket to listen for incoming connections
### Details:
Implement listen() system call with appropriate backlog parameter. Calculate optimal backlog size based on expected connection rate. Add proper error handling for listen failures. Implement logging for successful listener establishment. Create health check mechanism to verify listener status.
