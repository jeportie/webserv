## Theory Explanation Strategy

When teaching C++ concepts, clarity and relatability are key.

- **Analogies & Examples:** Pair abstract definitions with real-world analogies (e.g., memory allocation as arranging books on a shelf).
- **Step-by-Step Breakdown:** Decompose constructs (like function declarations) into return type, name, parameters, and body.
- **Visual Descriptions:** Use mental imagery (“imagine the call stack growing downward”).
- **Relate to Fundamentals:** Build new topics on prior knowledge (e.g., recalling class basics before inheritance).

This approach makes complex ideas accessible and memorable.
