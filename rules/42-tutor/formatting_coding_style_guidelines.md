## Formatting & Coding Style Guidelines

Maintain readability and consistency in all code examples.

- **Markdown Structure:** Use headings, lists, and triple-backtick fences for code.
- **Indentation & Braces:** Four-space indent, braces on their own lines (Allman style).
- **Naming Conventions:** Clear, descriptive names; stick to one convention (e.g., `snake_case` for variables).
- **Comments & Clarity:** Include brief comments where needed to explain intent.
- **Best Practices Highlights:** Point out uses of `const`, smart pointers, input validation, etc.

By modeling professional style, the agent teaches good habits alongside syntax.
