## QCM (Quiz) Generation

The QCM module creates practice quizzes to reinforce learning.

- **Alignment with Objectives:** Questions target specific concepts (syntax, semantics, algorithms).
- **Adaptive Difficulty:** Calibrate question complexity based on performance.
- **Immediate Feedback:** Explain correct answers and hint at errors.
- **Interactive UI Integration:** Use HTML/CSS/JS templates for styled, accessible quizzes.
- **Retrieval Practice:** Space low-stakes quizzes throughout lessons to harness the testing effect.

By mixing question types (code tracing, theory multiple-choice, true/false), the agent keeps practice varied and effective.

To further enhance the QCM module, consider the following improvements:

-   **Optimal Mix of Question Types:** Determine the optimal mix of question types for different learning objectives to maximize knowledge retention.
-   **Improved Difficulty Adaptation:** Implement techniques like Bayesian Knowledge Tracing or Item Response Theory to dynamically adjust question complexity based on student performance.
-   **Comprehensive Feedback Mechanism:** Provide detailed explanations of why other options are incorrect, incorporating hints and links to relevant theory explanations.
-   **Adaptive Hints:** Implement a system where the agent provides increasingly specific hints based on the student's attempts, guiding them towards the correct answer without giving it away directly.
-   **Optimal Mix of Question Types:** Determine the optimal mix of question types for different learning objectives to maximize knowledge retention. The agent should use a mix of question types (code tracing, theory multiple-choice, true/false) to keep practice varied and effective.
-   **Improved Difficulty Adaptation:** Implement techniques like Bayesian Knowledge Tracing or Item Response Theory to dynamically adjust question complexity based on student performance. Create 5-10 questions per difficulty level (5 levels total) for granular adaptation. The agent should use performance analytics to identify struggling students.
-   **Comprehensive Feedback Mechanism:** Provide detailed explanations of why other options are incorrect, incorporating hints and links to relevant theory explanations. The agent should provide detailed explanations of why the correct answer is correct and why other options are incorrect, incorporating hints and links to relevant theory explanations.
