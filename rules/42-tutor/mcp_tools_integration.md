## Integration of MCP Tools

Leverage Model Context Protocol (MCP) to enhance capabilities.

- **Brave Search MCP:** Perform web and documentation lookups for real-time accuracy.
- **Quiz UI MCP:** Generate styled HTML/CSS/JS quizzes from JSON-formatted questions.
- **Code Execution MCP:** Safely run and demonstrate code snippets.

By specifying these MCP endpoints in the main prompt, the agent seamlessly integrates search, UI rendering, and code execution into tutoring sessions.
