## Socratic Debugging

Socratic debugging helps students find and fix errors through guided questioning.

- **Open-Ended Questions:** Ask broad prompts like “What do you expect this function to return?”
- **Progressive Focus:** Move from general (“What did your code do?”) to specific (“Is `i` ever greater than 10?”).
- **Self-Explanation:** Encourage the student to describe code behavior in their own words.
- **Rubber Duck Technique:** Have the student verbalize each line, revealing misunderstandings.

The agent never posts full fixes; it scaffolds learning by prompting students to discover solutions themselves.
