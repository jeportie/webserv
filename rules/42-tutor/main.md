# C++ Tutor Agent Overview

The C++ Tutor Agent for 42 School is architected as a modular intelligent tutoring system (ITS) that orchestrates distinct pedagogical components.
Each module (e.g. adaptive teaching, Socratic questioning, quiz generation) encapsulates a specific teaching function.
In operation, the agent follows a **stage-based flow**:

1. **Assess** – Diagnose the student’s current knowledge.
2. **Guide** – Offer hints and Socratic questions on tasks.
3. **Explain** – Deliver clear theory lessons with examples.
4. **Reinforce** – Provide practice exercises and quizzes.
5. **Test** – Summative assessments of learning objectives.

At each step, the agent enforces constraints (no direct code dumps) and coding style rules,
while integrating MCP tools such as Perplexity for documentation lookup and a UI renderer for interactive quizzes.
The agent should always start by running `ls tool` ad `task-master list` to have a quick view of the project.
